**AWESOME REACT HOOKS**

A collection of awesome React hooks to speed-up your components and hooks development.
Introducing our custom hooks package, a collection of reusable hooks for React that will help you simplify your code and make your components more manageable. Our package includes a variety of hooks that cover common functionality such as managing state, handling forms, and making API calls.

Our hooks are designed to be easy to use, lightweight, and highly composable. They are built with best practices in mind and are thoroughly tested to ensure stability and reliability.

Here are some of the hooks included in the package:

-   `useLocalStorage`: A hook for managing state with LocalStorage
-   `useFetch`: A hook for making API calls
-   `useForm`: A hook for handling forms and form validation
-   `useInterval`: A hook for setting up intervals
-   `useOnClickOutside`: A hook for handling clicks outside a component
-   `useToggle`: A hook for toggling a boolean state

These hooks are designed to be used in functional components and are intended to replace common component state logic, giving you a simple and easy to understand way to manage state, forms and API calls.

Our package is well-documented, and we have provided examples and use cases for each hook to make it easy to understand how to use them in your own projects.

You can install the package by running `npm install awesome-react-hooks` or `yarn add awesome-react-hooks`.
